            <h2 id="head-line">Here is a timeline of Alan Turing's life: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1912: </strong>Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
                <li><strong>1927: </strong>Furthers his love of science and maths by reading Einstein whilst at Sherborne.</li>
                <li><strong>1934: </strong>Graduates with distinction in Mathematics from King's College, Cambridge</li>
                <li><strong>1938: </strong>Goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD</li>
                <li><strong>1939: </strong>He join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared</li>
                <li><strong>1940: </strong>With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe to decipher the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.</li>
                <li><strong>1943-45: </strong>He works with top people in the USA, which he visits to share information on code breaking.</li>
                <li><strong>1945: </strong>At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.</li>
                <li><strong>1946: </strong>He publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.</li>
                <li><strong>1949: </strong>He is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University.</li>
                <li><strong>1950: </strong>He publishes the famous paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test.</li>
                <li><strong>1951: </strong>He is elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and also gives talks about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC.</li>
                <li><strong>1952: </strong>He is arrested for gross indecency. He loses his security clearance so he cannot work. He is offered chemical treatment instead of going to prison. The treatment makes him very unwell.</li>
